# Privacy Policy

**Medication Tracker**
*Last updated: February 6, 2026*

## Overview

Medication Tracker is designed with your privacy in mind. The app operates entirely on your device and does not collect, transmit, or share any personal information.

## Data Storage

All medication data you enter (medication names, dosing schedules, dose history, and notes) is stored locally on your device. This data is never sent to any server, cloud service, or third party.

## Data Collection

We do not collect any data from you, including:

- Personal information
- Usage analytics
- Device information
- Location data
- Health data

## Notifications

Medication Tracker uses local notifications to remind you when medications are due. These notifications are processed entirely on your device and are not routed through any external server.

## Third-Party Services

Medication Tracker does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete all app data at any time by deleting the app. No data will remain on any server because none was ever transmitted.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, the changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
